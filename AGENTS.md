# Cursor agent in this project

This is the **asyla** project. Cursor is expected to **document and improve its own workflows** here.

## How the agent should work

- Keep Cursor-for-Cursor artifacts under `.cursor/` (rules, skills, notes, helpers).
- After non-trivial or repeatable workflows, add a rule/skill/helper so future sessions improve.

## Current artifacts

- Rule: `.cursor/rules/self-document-workflows.mdc`
