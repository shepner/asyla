# Internal reverse proxy for d01 (split-DNS / Pi-hole)
# When app hostnames resolve to d01 (e.g. via Pi-hole), this serves HTTPS and proxies to apps.
# TLS is self-signed (accept once in browser).
#
# Start after any app that needs internal proxy is running (app network must exist).
# Ports 80 and 443 must not be used by another service on d01.
