# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# DO NOT commit .env to git - it contains secrets

# Option A: Token-based (remote config) - add each hostname manually in dashboard
# Get from: Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels → Create tunnel → Cloudflared
TUNNEL_TOKEN=your-tunnel-token-here

# Option B: Config file (automated hostnames from apps.yml)
# Create tunnel once in dashboard, install with "Cloudflared", save credentials JSON as credentials.json here.
# Set TUNNEL_ID (the tunnel UUID, e.g. from the credentials filename).
# Then: ./generate-config.sh  and  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.config.yml up -d
# TUNNEL_ID=your-tunnel-uuid-here
