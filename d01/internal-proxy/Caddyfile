# Internal reverse proxy for d01
# Add hostname blocks as apps are deployed. When Pi-hole (or split DNS) points
# a hostname to d01's IP, this serves that hostname and proxies to the app.
# TLS: self-signed (Caddy "internal") - browsers will show a one-time warning.
#
# Example when you add an app:
#   myapp.asyla.org {
#       tls internal
#       reverse_proxy myapp-service:8080
#   }
#
# Placeholder so Caddy starts without errors (no hostnames yet)
# Add hostname blocks above this when apps are deployed
